          <bc-event title="Olga's Death">
            Olga was hit by a car. She was 22, was attending Community College, and had a job as a receptionist at a doctors office. Julia loved and hated her at the same time: She loved her sister, and they would do a lot together. But as they got older, Julia became inscreasingly frustrated by Ogla's content to live a traditional life. Julia feels like she could have done something to stop her from crossing the street, and that gives her a lot of sadness she has no one to vent to.

        <bc-block width="100">
          Olga's death was the straw that broke the camel's back for Julia's family. Julia and Amá could not find any common ground, and Julia grew increasingly frustrated at all the restrictions she faced, and she had nowhere to vent her feelings, so they kept building and building and building.
          Amá became overprotective towards Julia, and went against Julia's wishes to try to give her everything she wishes she could have given Olga.<br>
          Julia also becomes very curious about everything that Olga never told her, and gets very desperate trying to figure out what her sister's life was really like.<br>
          While Amá becomes more and more restrictive, Julia's curiosity and sadness keeps building up.<br>
          Julia meets Connor, and they quickly become very close and start dating. He's one of the few people Julia trusts and can confide her emotions in.<br>
          Julia finds lingerie and a hotel key in Olga's room. She hides them in her room for easier access.<br>
          But the next day, she finds Amá crying with the lingerie. She found it in Julia's room, is disgusted and upset, and refuses to listen to ant of Julia's explainations. Amá takes Julia's notebook away, the only thing she could use to let out her emotions.<br>
          Because of how upset her mother is, Julia can no longer contact Connor, except by payphone. When Connor expresses how much he wants to see Julia again, she gets frustrated and hangs up. Their breakup adds more to the ever-increasing stress and sadness in Julia.<br>
          <br>
          Amá blames Julia for Olga's death, something Julia had blamed herself for at points, but tried to deny.

          <bc-event title="Metal Health">A major theme of <i>I am not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter</i> is mental health. Julia struggles with undiagnosed anxiety and depression throughout the book, until in the face of Amá destroying the last shreds of her freedom because of Olga's lingerie, her and Connor not being able to see each other, and Amá blaming her for Olga's death, she slits her wrists.</bc-event>

          <bc-blockquote credit="Julia">I wake up in a hospital bed, with Amá peering over me. I have a headache so deep it feels like someone pummeled my brain with a meat tenderizer. For a few seconds, I'm confused about what I'm doing there, but then I look at my wrists and remember what I did last night.</bc-blockquote>
          <bc-blockquote credit="Julia">I don't know what to say. How could I possibly explain this? I begin to cry, which gets Amá started, too. I've never been very good at life, but, man, was this a stupid thing to do.</bc-blockquote>
