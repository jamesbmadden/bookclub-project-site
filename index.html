          <bc-event title="Olga's Death">
            Olga was hit by a car. She was 22, was attending Community College, and had a job as a receptionist at a doctors office. Julia loved and hated her at the same time: She loved her sister, and they would do a lot together. But as they got older, Julia became inscreasingly frustrated by Ogla's content to live a traditional life. Julia feels like she could have done something to stop her from crossing the street, and that gives her a lot of sadness she has no one to vent to.

            Olga's death was the straw that broke the camel's back for Julia's family. Julia and Amá could not find any common ground, and Julia grew increasingly frustrated at all the restrictions she faced.
            Amá became overprotective towards Julia, and went against Julia's wishes to try to give her everything she wishes she could have given Olga.<br>
            Julia also becomes very curious about everything that Olga never told her, and gets very desperate trying to figure out what her sister's life was really like.<br>
            While Amá becomes more and more restrictive, Julia's curiosity and sadness keeps building up.<br>
            Julia finds lingerie and a hotel key in Olga's room. She hides them in her room for easier access.<br>
            But the next day, she finds Amá crying with the lingerie. She found it in Julia's room, is disgusted and upset.<br>
            <br>
            Amá blames Julia for Olga's death, something Julia had blamed herself for at points, but tried to deny.

        <div class="text-align-centre">
          <bc-event title="Metal Health">A major theme of <i>I am not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter</i> is mental health. Julia struggles with undiagnosed anxiety and depression throughout the book, until in the face of Amá destroying the last shreds of her freedom because of Olga's lingerie, and Amá blaming her for Olga's death, she slits her wrists.</bc-event>
        </div>
        <div class="block-container">
          <bc-blockquote credit="Julia">I wake up in a hospital bed, with Amá peering over me. I have a headache so deep it feels like someone pummeled my brain with a meat tenderizer. For a few seconds, I'm confused about what I'm doing there, but then I look at my wrists and remember what I did last night.</bc-blockquote>
          <bc-blockquote credit="Julia">I don't know what to say. How could I possibly explain this? I begin to cry, which gets Amá started, too. I've never been very good at life, but, man, was this a stupid thing to do.</bc-blockquote>

            Julia goes into therapy, and Amá finally realises what she's being going through, and tries to be more accepting. However, Amá decides the solution is to send Julia to her village in Mexico, where her extended family lives. Even though Julia does not want to go, Amá makes her.
          </bc-block>
        </div>
        <div class="block-container">
          <bc-event title="Family">
            Another theme in <i>I am not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter</i> is family. Family is an important part of traditional mexican culture, something that Julia's parents love, but Julia would rather be alone. Throughout the book, Julia and Amá learn to accept each other as family, despite their differences. After Julia's therapy, Amá thinks that reconnecting with her family in Mexico will help Julia.
          </bc-event>
          <bc-event title="Immigration">
            While in Mexico, Julia learns a lot about her parents history, and why they are so guarded today. She finds out while crossing the border, Amá was raped while Apá was held at gunpoint, which lead to Julia's sister, Olga. The struggle of immigrating to provide one's children with a better life underpins a lot of the events and plotlines of the story, but is rarely directly adressed.

        </div>
        <div class="text-align-centre">
          <bc-event title="Ending">
            In the end, Amá reluctantly accepts Julia's dreams of going off to university in New York. After many rejections, Julia finally gets accepted into NYU. The book ends with her leaving Chicago, saying goodbye to her family, and reflecting on her life on the plane. 
          </bc-event>
        </div>
        <div class="text-align-centre">
          <bc-blockquote credit="Julia">
            In some ways, I think that part of what I'm trying to accomplish - whether Amá really understands it or not - is to live for her, Apá, and Olga. It's  not that I'm living life <i>for</i> them, exactly, but I have so many choices they've never had, and I feel like I can do so much with what I've been given. What a waste  their journey would be if I just settled for a dull, mediocre life. Maybe one day they'll realize that.
